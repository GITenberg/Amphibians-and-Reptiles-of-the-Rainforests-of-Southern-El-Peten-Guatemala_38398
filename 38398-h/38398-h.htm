<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Early in 1960 an unusual opportunity arose to carry on biological
    field work in the midst of virgin rainforest in southern El Petén,
    Guatemala. At that time the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala had
    an air strip and camp at Chinajá, from which place the company
    was constructing a road northward through the forest. In mid-February,
    1960, J. Knox Jones, Jr. and I flew into El Petén to
    collect and study mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. While enjoying
    the comforts of the fine field camp at Chinajá, we worked
    in the surrounding forest and availed ourselves of the opportunity
    to be on hand when the road crews were cutting the tall trees in
    the forest, thereby bringing to the ground many interesting specimens
    of the arboreal fauna. We stayed at Chinajá until late March,
    with the exception of a week spent at Toocog, another camp of the
    Ohio Oil Company located 15 kilometers southeast of La Libertad
    and on the edge of the savanna. Thus, at Toocog we were able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> to work both in the forest and on the savanna. In the summer of
    1960, John Wellman accompanied me to El Petén for two weeks
    in June and July. Most of our time was spent at Chinajá, but a
    few days were spent at Toocog and other localities in south-central
    El Petén.</p>
<p>Many areas in Guatemala have been studied intensively by
    L. C. Stuart, who has published on the herpetofauna of the forested
    area of northeastern El Petén (1958), the savannas of central
    El Petén (1935), and the humid mountainous region to the south
    of El Petén in Alta Verapaz (1948 and 1950). The area studied
    by me and my companions is covered with rainforest and lies to
    the north of the highlands of Alta Verapaz and to the south of the
    savannas of central El Petén. A few specimens of amphibians
    and reptiles were obtained in this area in 1935 by C. L. Hubbs
    and Henry van der Schalie; this collection, reported on by Stuart
    (1937), contained only one species, <i>Cochranella fleischmanni</i>, not
    present in our collection of 77 species and 617 specimens.</p>
<h3><a name="Acknowledgments" id="Acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a></h3>
<p>I am grateful to L. C. Stuart of the University of Michigan, who made the
    initial arrangements for our work in El Petén, aided me in the identification
    of certain specimens, and helped in the preparation of this report. J. Knox
    Jones, Jr. and John Wellman were able field companions, who added greatly
    to the number of specimens in the collection. In Guatemala, Clark M.
    Shimeall and Harold Hoopman of the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala made
    available to us the facilities of the company's camps at Chinajá and Toocog.
    Alberto Alcain and Luis Escaler welcomed us at Chinajá and gave us every
    possible assistance. Juan Monteras and Antonio Aldaña made our stay at
    Toocog enjoyable and profitable. During our visits to southern El Petén, Julio
    Bolón C. worked for us as a collector, and between March and June he collected
    and saved many valuable specimens; his knowledge of the forest and
    its inhabitants was a great asset to our work. Jorge A. Ibarra, Director of
    the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Guatemala assisted us in obtaining
    necessary permits and extended other kindnesses. To all of these people I
    am indebted for the essential parts that they played in the completion of this
    study.</p>
<p>Field work in the winter of 1960 was made possible by funds from the
    American Heart Association for the purposes of collecting mammalian hearts.
    My field work in the summer of 1960 was supported by a grant from the
    Graduate Research Fund of the University of Kansas.</p>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_AREA" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_AREA"></a>DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA</h2>
<p>A vast lowland region stretches northward for approximately
    700 kilometers from the highlands of Guatemala to the Gulf of
    Mexico. The northern two-thirds of this low plain is bordered on
    three sides by seas and forms the Yucatán Peninsula. The lowlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> at the base of the Yucatán Peninsula make up the Departamento
    El Petén of Guatemala. The area with which this report is concerned
    consists of the south-central part of El Petén.</p>
<h3><a name="Physiography" id="Physiography">Physiography</a></h3>
<p>Immediately south of Chinajá is a range of hills, the Serrania de Chinajá,
    having an almost due east-west axis and a crest of about 600 meters above
    sea level. South of the Serrania de Chinajá are succeedingly higher ridges
    building up to the Meseta de Cobán and Sierra de Pocolha and eventually
    to the main Guatemalan highlands. The northern face of the Serrania de
    Chinajá is a fault scarp dropping abruptly from about 650 meters at the crest
    to about 140 meters at the base. From the base of the Serrania de Chinajá
    northward to the Río de la Pasión at Sayaxché the terrain is gently rolling
    and has a total relief of about 50 meters. North of the Río de la Pasión is
    a low dome reaching an elevation of 170 meters at La Libertad; see Stuart
    (1935:12) for further discussion of the physiography of central El Petén.
    The rocks in southern El Petén are predominately Miocene marine limestones;
    there are occasional pockets of Pliocene deposits. There is little evidence
    of subterranean solution at Chinajá, but northward in central El Petén karsting
    is common. The upper few inches of soil is humus rich in organic matter;
    below this is clay.</p>
<h3><a name="Climate" id="Climate">Climate</a></h3>
<p>The climate of El Petén is tropical with equable temperatures throughout
    the year. Temperatures at Chinajá varied between a night-time low of 65° F.
    and a daytime high of 91° F. during the time of our visits. In the Köppen
    system of classification the climate at Chinajá and Toocog is Af. Rain falls
    throughout the year, but there is a noticeable dry season. To anyone who
    has traveled from south to north in El Petén and the Yucatán Peninsula, it is
    obvious from the changes in vegetation that there is a decrease in rainfall
    from south to north. There is a noticeable difference between Chinajá and
    Toocog. Although rainfall data are not available for Chinajá and Toocog,
    there are records for nearby stations (Sapper, 1932). At Paso Caballos on
    the Río San Pedro about 40 kilometers northwest of Toocog the average
    annual rainfall amounts to 1620 mm.; the driest month is March (21 mm.),
    and the wettest months are June (269 mm.) and September (265 mm.). At
    Cubilquitz, Alta Verapaz, about 35 kilometers south-southwest of Chinajá
    and at an elevation of 300 meters, the average annual rainfall is 4006 mm.;
    the driest month is March (128 mm.), and the wettest months are July (488
    mm.) and October (634 mm.).</p>
<p>During the 18 days in February and March, 1960, that we kept records on
    the weather at Chinajá moderate to heavy showers occurred on seven days.
    During our stay there in June and July rain fell every day, as it did in Toocog.
    However, during the week spent at Toocog in March no rain fell.</p>
<h3><a name="Vegetation" id="Vegetation">Vegetation</a></h3>
<p>The vegetation of northern and central El Petén has been studied by
    Lundell (1937), who made only passing remarks concerning the plants of the
    southern part of El Petén. No floristic studies have been made there. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> following remarks are necessarily brief and are intended only to give the
    reader a general picture of the forest. I have included names of a few of
    the commoner trees that I recognized.</p>
<p>Chinajá is located in a vast expanse of unbroken rainforest. In this forest
    there is a noticeable stratification of the vegetation. Three strata are apparent;
    in the uppermost layer the tops of the trees are from 40 to 50 meters above
    the ground. The spreading crowns of the trees and the interlacing vines form
    a nearly continuous canopy over the lower layers. Among the common trees
    in the upper stratum are <i>Calophyllum brasiliense</i>, <i>Castilla elastica</i>, <i>Cedrela
    mexicana</i>, <i>Ceiba pentandra</i>, <i>Didalium guianense</i>, <i>Ficus</i> sp., <i>Sideroxylon lundelli</i>, <i>Swietenia macrophylla</i>, and <i>Vitex</i> sp. (Pl. 1, fig. 1). The middle layer of
    trees have crowns about 25 meters above the ground; these trees in some
    places where the upper canopy is missing form the tallest trees in the forest. This
    is especially true on steep hillsides. Common trees in the middle layer include <i>Achras zapote</i>, <i>Bombax ellipticum</i>, <i>Cecropia mexicana</i>, <i>Orbignya cohune</i>, and <i>Sabal</i> sp. The lowermost layer reaches a height of about 10 meters; in many
    places in the forest this layer is absent. Common trees in the lower stratum
    include <i>Crysophila argentea</i>, <i>Cymbopetalum penduliflorum</i>, <i>Casearia</i> sp., and <i>Hasseltia dioica</i>.</p>
<p>The ground cover is sparce; apparently only a few small herbs and ferns
    live on the heavily shaded forest floor. Important herpetological habitats
    include the leaf litter, rotting stumps, and rotting tree trunks on the forest
    floor and the buttresses of many of the gigantic trees, especially <i>Ceiba pentandra</i> (Pl. 2). Epiphytes, especially various kinds of bromeliads, are common.
    Most frequently these are in the trees in the upper and middle strata.</p>
<p>At Toocog there is sharp break between savanna and forest (Pl. 7, fig. 2).
    The forest is noticeably drier and more open than at Chinajá (Pl. 9). The
    crowns of the trees are lower, and there is no nearly continuous canopy between
    40 and 50 meters above the ground. Although <i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> and
    other large trees occur, they are less common than at Chinajá. Especially
    common at Toocog are <i>Achras zapote</i>, <i>Brosimum alicastrum</i>, and various species
    of <i>Ficus</i>.</p>

        Chinajá is located just to the north of the Alta Verapaz&mdash;El Petén boundary;
        recent surveys place the location just to the south of the imaginary line
        through the rainforest. Field work was conducted in the immediate vicinity
        of the camp, on the lower slopes of the Serrania de Chinajá, and at several
        sites to the northwest and north-northwest of Chinajá, where the forest
        was being cleared. The entire area supports rainforest.</p>
    <p>La Libertad.&mdash;Lat. 16° 47´, long. 90° 07´, elev., 170 m. A town on the

<h2><a name="THE_HERPETOFAUNA_OF_THE_RAINFOREST" id="THE_HERPETOFAUNA_OF_THE_RAINFOREST"></a>THE HERPETOFAUNA OF THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>In presenting an account of the herpetofauna of southern El Petén three
    items need to be considered: (1) The composition of the fauna; (2) the
    ecology of the fauna; (3) the relationships of the fauna. Each of these
    topics is discussed briefly below. Logically a discussion of the origin of the
    fauna should follow, but this is being withheld for inclusion in a report
    on the herpetofauna of the entire El Petén by L. C. Stuart and the author;
    at that time the above topics will be expanded to cover the herpetofauna of
    the whole region.</p>

<h3><a name="Ecology_of_the_Herpetofauna_" id="Ecology_of_the_Herpetofauna_">Ecology of the Herpetofauna</a></h3>
<p>Our two visits to Chinajá and Toocog afforded the opportunity
    to gather data on the ecology of the rainforests of southern El Petén
    and to study the relationships between the environment and members
    of the herpetofauna. Tropical rainforests present the optimum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> conditions for life, and it is in this environment that life
    reaches its greatest diversity. Here, too, biological inter-relationships
    are most complex. This complexity is illustrated by the
    presence of many species of some genera, all of which are found
    together in the same geographic region. In the rainforests of
    southern El Petén there are six species of <i>Anolis</i>, five of <i>Hyla</i>,
    four of <i>Bothrops</i>, and three of <i>Coniophanes</i>. Obviously, the diversity
    of ecological niches in the rainforest is sufficient to support
    a variety of related species. Of the examples mentioned above,
    fairly adequate ecological data were obtained for most of the
    species of <i>Anolis</i>, which will be used to show the ecological diversity
    and vertical stratification of sympatric species in the rainforests.</p>
<p>Of the six species of <i>Anolis</i>, all except <i>A. sericeus</i> are typically
    found in humid forests. <i>Anolis sericeus sericeus</i> is poorly represented
    in the collections from southern El Petén, where it may be
    in competition with <i>Anolis limifrons rodriguezi</i> that resembles <i>Anolis
    s. sericeus</i> in size, coloration, and habits. Therefore, <i>Anolis sericeus
    sericeus</i> is excluded from the following discussion. The common
    terrestrial species is <i>Anolis humilis uniformis</i>; sometimes
    this small species perches or suns on the bases of small trees or
    buttresses of some large trees. When disturbed it takes to the
    ground and seeks cover in the leaf litter or beneath logs or palm
    fronds. <i>Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei</i> is about twice the size of <i>Anolis humilis uniformis</i> and is usually observed on buttresses of
    large trees or on the lower two meters of tree trunks. Individuals
    were seen foraging on the ground along with <i>Anolis humilis
    uniformis</i>. At no time were <i>Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei</i> observed
    to ascend the trunks of large trees; they always took refuge near
    the bases of trees. <i>Anolis limifrons rodriguezi</i> is found on the
    stems and branches of bushes. It is a small species that sometimes
    is observed on the ground but was never seen ascending large
    trees. <i>Anolis capito</i> is about the same size as <i>Anolis lemurinus
    bourgeaei</i> and lives on the trunks of large trees. In the tops of
    the trees lives a large green species, <i>Anolis biporcatus</i>.</p>
<p>Similar segregation habitatwise can be demonstrated for other
    members of the herpetofauna. The avoidance of interspecific
    competition in feeding is well illustrated by three species of snakes
    that probably are the primary ophidian predators on frogs. <i>Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus</i> is diurnal and terrestrial;
    it feeds on frogs at the edges of breeding ponds by day. Also
    during the day <i>Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus</i> feeds on frogs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> bushes and trees. At night the activities of both of these species
    is replaced by those of <i>Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta</i>, which
    not only feeds on the frogs in the trees and bushes, but descends
    to the ground and even enters the water in search of food.</p>
<p>From the examples discussed above, the importance of the
    three dimensional aspect of the rainforest is apparent. The
    presence of a large and diverse habitat above the ground is of
    great significance in the rainforest, for of the non-aquatic components
    of the herpetofauna in the rainforests of southern El Petén,
    42 per cent of the species spend at least part of their lives in the
    bushes and trees. Another important part of the forest is the
    subterranean level&mdash;the rich mulch, underground tunnels, and
    rotting subterranean vegetation. Of the 78 species of amphibians
    and reptiles in southern El Petén, seven are primarily fossorial, and
    half-a-dozen others are secondarily fossorial. Probably the fossorial
    members of the fauna are the least well represented in the
    collection, for such widespread species as <i>Dermophis mexicanus
    mexicanus</i>, <i>Rhadinaea decorata decorata</i> and <i>Tantilla schistosa
    schistosa</i> were expected, but not found.</p>
<p>In the following discussion of the ecological distribution of
    amphibians and reptiles in the rainforest I have depended chiefly
    on my observations made in southern El Petén, but have taken
    into consideration observations made on the same species in other
    regions, together with reports from other workers. The reader
    should keep in mind that the evidence varies from species to species.
    Of some species I have observed only one animal in the
    field; of others, I have seen scores and sometimes hundreds of
    individuals. For species on which I have few observations or
    rather inconclusive evidence, the circumstance of inadequate
    data is mentioned.</p>
<p>In analyzing the ecological distribution within the forest, it is
    convenient to recognize five subdivisions (habitats); each is
    treated below as a unit.</p>
<p>1. <span class="smcap">Aquatic.</span>&mdash;This habitat includes permanent streams and rivers
    (Pl. 10, fig. 1), some of which are clear and others muddy. In
    the rainy season temporary ponds form in depressions on the forest
    floor (Pl. 10, fig. 2); these are important as breeding sites for
    many species of amphibians. Aquatic members of the herpetofauna
    are here considered to be those species that either spend
    the greatest part of their lives in the water or usually retreat to
    water for shelter. Seven species of turtles and one crocodilian are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> aquatic. Of these, <i>Dermatemys mawi</i>, <i>Staurotypus triporcatus</i>,
    and <i>Pseudemys scripta ornata</i> inhabit clear water, whereas <i>Chelydra
    rossignoni</i>, <i>Claudius angustatus</i>, <i>Kinosternon acutum</i>, and <i>K. leucostomum</i> inhabit muddy water. <i>Crocodylus moreleti</i> apparently
    inhabits both clear and muddy water, for in the dry season it
    lives along the clear rivers, but in the rainy season inhabits flooded
    areas in the forest as well.</p>
<p>2. <span class="smcap">Aquatic Margin.</span>&mdash;Extensive marshes were lacking in the
    part of southern El Petén that I visited; consequently, the aquatic
    margin habitat is there limited to the edges of rivers and borders
    of temporary ponds. <i>Bufo marinus</i>, <i>Rana palmipes</i>, and <i>Rana
    pipiens</i> are characteristic inhabitants of the aquatic margin,
    although in the rainy reason <i>Bufo marinus</i> often is found away
    from water. Observations indicate that <i>Tretanorhinus nigroluteus
    lateralis</i> inhabits the margins of ponds and streams and actually
    spends considerable time in the water. Although <i>Iguana iguana
    rhinolopha</i> is arboreal, it lives in trees along rivers, into which it
    plunges upon being disturbed. Species included in this category
    are those that customarily spend most of their lives at the edge
    of permanent water. Frogs and toads that migrate to the water
    for breeding and the snakes that prey on the frogs at that time
    are not assigned to the aquatic-margin habitat.</p>
<p>3. <span class="smcap">Fossorial.</span>&mdash;Characteristic inhabitants of the mulch on the
    forest floor are <i>Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri</i>, <i>Lepidophyma flavimaculatum
    flavimaculatum</i>, <i>Scincella cherriei cherriei</i>, <i>Ninia sebae
    sebae</i>, <i>Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis</i>, and <i>Micrurus affinis apiatus</i>.
    Other species of snakes that spend most of their lives above ground
    often forage in the mulch layer; among these are <i>Coniophanes
    bipunctatus biserialis</i>, <i>Coniophanes fissidens fissidens</i>, <i>Coniophanes
    imperialis clavatus</i>, <i>Lampropeltis doliata polyzona</i>, and <i>Stenorrhina
    degenhardti</i>. Among the amphibians, at least <i>Hypopachus cuneus
    nigroreticulatus</i>, <i>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</i>, and <i>Syrrhophus leprus</i> are known to seek shelter in the mulch.</p>
<p>4. <span class="smcap">Terrestrial.</span>&mdash;One turtle, <i>Geoemyda areolata</i>, is primarily
    terrestrial. Among the lizards, conspicuous terrestrial species are <i>Anolis humilis uniformis</i> and <i>Ameiva festiva edwardsi</i>; <i>Anolis
    lemurinus bourgeaei</i> and <i>Basiliscus vittatus</i> spend part of their
    lives on the ground, but also live on trees and in bushes. <i>Eumeces
    schwartzei</i> and <i>E. sumichrasti</i> apparently are terrestrial. The only
    terrestrial lizard that is nocturnal is <i>Coleonyx elegans elegans</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> by day hides in the leaf litter or below ground. Nocturnal amphibians
    that are terrestrial include <i>Bufo marinus</i>, <i>Bufo valliceps
    valliceps</i>, <i>Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus</i>, <i>Syrrhophus leprus</i>,
    and <i>Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus</i>. A large number of active
    diurnal snakes are terrestrial; these include <i>Boa constrictor imperator</i>, <i>Clelia clelia clelia</i>, <i>Dryadophis melanolomus laevis</i>, <i>Drymarchon
    corais melanurus</i>, <i>Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus</i>, <i>Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus</i>, and <i>Spilotes pullatus mexicanus</i>.
    Nocturnal terrestrial snakes include three kinds of <i>Bothrops</i> (<i>B.
    atrox asper</i>, <i>B. nasutus</i>, and <i>B. nummifer nummifer</i>), all of which
    seem to be equally active by day.</p>
<p>5. <span class="smcap">Arboreal.</span>&mdash;In this habitat the third dimension (height) of
    the rainforest probably is the most complex insofar as the inter-relationships
    of species and ecological niches are concerned. I
    have attempted to categorize species as to microhabitats within
    the arboreal habitat; in so doing, I recognize four subdivisions&mdash;bushes,
    tree trunks, tree tops, and epiphytes.</p>
<p>Bush inhabitants include several species of lizards and snakes,
    all of which have rather elongate, slender bodies, and long tails.
    Common bush-inhabitants in southern El Petén are <i>Anolis limifrons
    rodriguezi</i>, <i>Basiliscus vittatus</i>, <i>Laemanctus deborrei</i>, <i>Leptophis
    mexicanus mexicanus</i>, and <i>Oxybelis aeneus aeneus</i>. All of these
    are diurnal, and all but <i>Laemanctus</i> have been observed sleeping
    on bushes at night.</p>
<p>Tree-trunk inhabitants include five species of lizards. <i>Thecadactylus
    rapicaudus</i> lives on the trunks of large trees; <i>Sphaerodactylus
    lineolatus</i> lives beneath the bark on dead trees and on
    corozo palms. <i>Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei</i> lives on the bases and
    buttresses of large trees, from which it often descends to the ground. <i>Corythophanes cristatus</i> and <i>Anolis capito</i> were found only on tree
    trunks and large vines.</p>
<p>The least information is available for the species living in the
    tree tops. The following species were obtained from tops of trees
    when they were felled, or have been observed living in the tree
    tops: <i>Anolis biporcatus</i>, <i>Iguana iguana rhinolopha</i>, <i>Celestus rozellae</i>, <i>Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta</i>, <i>Leptophis ahaetulla
    praestans</i>, <i>Sibon dimidiata dimidiata</i>, and <i>Sibon nebulata nebulata</i>.</p>
<p>Epiphytes, especially the bromeliads, provide refuge for a variety
    of tree frogs and small snakes. Of the tree frogs, <i>Hyla picta</i>, <i>Hyla
    staufferi</i>, <i>Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori</i>, <i>Similisca baudini</i>, and <i>Similisca phaeota cyanosticta</i> have been found in bromeliads; other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> species probably occur there. Among the snakes, <i>Imantodes
    cenchoa leucomelas</i>, <i>Leptodeira frenata malleisi</i>, <i>Leptodeira
    septentrionalis polysticta</i>, <i>Sibon dimidiata dimidiata</i>, and <i>Sibon
    nebulata nebulata</i> are frequent inhabitants of bromeliads; all of
    these snakes are nocturnal.</p>
<h3><a name="Relationships_of_the_Fauna" id="Relationships_of_the_Fauna">Relationships of the Fauna</a></h3>
<p>Most of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles definitely
    known from the rainforest in southern El Petén have extensive
    ranges in the Atlantic lowlands of southern México and Central
    America; many extend into South America. Sixty-two (80%) of the
    species belong to this group having extensive ranges in Middle
    America. Three species (<i>Syrrhophus leprus</i>, <i>Leptodeira frenata</i>,
    and <i>Kinosternon acutum</i>) are at the southern limits of their distributions
    in southern El Petén and northern Alta Verapaz, whereas <i>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</i> and <i>Thecadactylus rapicaudus</i> are at
    the northern and western limits of their distributions in El Petén.
    Nine (11%) species have the center of their distributions in El
    Petén and the Yucatán Peninsula; representatives of this group
    include <i>Claudius angustatus</i>, <i>Dermatemys mawi</i>, <i>Laemanctus
    deborrei</i>, and <i>Eumeces schwartzei</i>.</p>
<p>In determining a measure of faunal resemblance, I have departed
    from the formulae discussed by Simpson (1960) and have analyzed
    the degree of resemblance by the following formula used to calculate
    an index of faunal relationships:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>C (2) / (N<sub>1</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>) = R, where</p>
    <p>C = species common to both faunas.</p>
    <p>N<sub>1</sub> = number of species in the first fauna.</p>
    <p>N<sub>2</sub> = number of species in the second fauna.</p>
    <p>R = degree of relationships (when R = 1.00, the faunas are identical; when R = 0, the faunas are completely different).</p>
</div>
<p>The herpetofauna of southern El Petén has been compared with
    that in the Tikal-Uaxactún area (Stuart, 1958), that in the humid
    lowlands of Alta Verapaz (Stuart, 1950, plus additional data), and
    that in the Mexican state of Yucatán (Smith and Taylor, 1945,
    1948, and 1950). The herpetofaunas of lowland Alta Verapaz and
    Yucatán are the largest, having respectively 94 and 91 species,
    where as there are 78 species known from southern El Petén and
    64 from the Tikal-Uaxactún area. An analysis of faunal relationships
    (Table 2) shows that the faunas of the rainforests of southern
    El Petén and lowland Alta Verapaz are closely related. The relationships
    between these two areas and the Tikal-Uaxactún area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> in northern El Petén is notably less. Apparently the biggest faunal
    changes take place between southern El Petén and the Tikal-Uaxactún
    area, and between the latter and Yucatán. As stated
    by Stuart (1958:7) the Tikal-Uaxactún is transitional between the
    humid rainforests to the south and the dry outer end of the Yucatán
    Peninsula. The transitional nature of the environment is exemplified
    by a rather depauperate herpetofauna consisting of some
    species of both dry and humid environments and lacking a large
    fauna typical of either. Contrariwise, the continuity of the environment
    from southern El Petén to the lowlands of Alta Verapaz
    is reflected in degree of resemblance of the herpetofaunas.</p>

<p>Most of the species of amphibians and reptiles found in southern
    El Petén are found in humid tropical forests from the Isthmus of
    Tehuantepec southeastward on the Atlantic lowlands well into
    Central America.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ACCOUNTS_OF_SPECIES" id="ACCOUNTS_OF_SPECIES"></a>ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES</h2>
<p>In the following pages various aspects of the occurrence, life
    histories, ecology, and variation of the species of amphibians and
    reptiles known from southern El Petén are discussed. Only <i>Cochranella
    fleischmanni</i> reported by Stuart (1937) from Río Subín
    at Santa Teresa was not collected by us and is excluded. Because
    more worthwhile information was gathered for some species than
    others, the length and completeness of the accounts vary. All
    specimens listed are in the Museum of Natural History at the
    University of Kansas, to which institution all catalog numbers refer.
    Preceding the discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> localities from which specimens were obtained; numbers after a
    locality indicate the number of specimens obtained at each locality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Bolitoglossa dofleini</b> (Werner)</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Chinajá, 1.</p>
</div>
<p>An adult female having minute ovarian eggs has a snout-vent
    length of 81 mm., a tail length of 59 mm., 13 costal grooves, two
    intercostal spaces between adpressed toes, 38-35 vomerine teeth
    in irregular rows forming a broad arch from a point posterolaterad
    to the internal nares to a point near the anterior edge of the
    parasphenoid teeth, and 43-44 maxilliary-premaxillary teeth. In
    life the dorsum was rusty brown with irregular black and orange
    spots and streaks. The flanks were bluish gray with black in the
    costal grooves and creamy tan flecks along the ventral edge of
    the flank. The belly and underside of the tail were yellowish tan
    with dark brown spots laterally. The limbs were orange proximally
    and black distally; the pads of the feet were bluish black. The
    dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tail were yellowish orange with
    black spots. The iris was grayish yellow.</p>
<p>Stuart (1943:17) reported this species from Finca Volcán, Alta
    Verapaz. He diagnosed his specimens as having 13 costal grooves
    and two or three intercostal spaces between adpressed toes. He
    stated that the vomerine teeth were about 12 in number and that
    in life the dorsum was mottled gray and black, the sides gray and
    brown, and the undersurfaces uniformly dark gray. These specimens
    differ noticeably from the individual from Chinajá in the
    number of vomerine teeth and in coloration.</p>
<p>In August, 1961, I obtained a specimen of <i>Bolitoglossa dofleini</i> at Finca Los Alpes, Alta Verapaz, approximately 13 kilometers
    airline south-southwest of Finca Volcán and at approximately the
    same elevation. Although the salamander was dead when found,
    it obviously was more heavily pigmented than the individual from
    Chinajá. The belly was bluish gray with black spots laterally;
    the dorsum was dull brownish gray with some brownish red streaks.
    The specimen is a female having small ovarian eggs, a snout-vent
    length of 90 mm., 13 costal grooves, and two intercostal spaces
    between adpressed limbs. There are 28-29 vomerine teeth, more
    than twice as many as in specimens from Finca Volcán (Stuart,
    1943:17), but noticeably fewer than in the specimen from Chinajá.</p>
<p>The presence of this species at Chinajá lends support to the idea
    that the specimen from the Río de la Pasión listed by Brocchi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> (1882:116) also is <i>Bolitoglossa dofleini</i>. Furthermore, the confirmed
    presence of this species in the lowlands of El Petén suggests
    that there may be genetic connection between <i>B. dofleini</i> in the
    Alta Verapaz and <i>B. yucatana</i> in the Yucatán Peninsula. <i>Bolitoglossa
    yucatana</i> differs from <i>B. dofleini</i> in having five intercostal
    spaces between adpressed toes and in having a different color
    pattern. Both are robust species having no close relationships to
    other species of <i>Bolitoglossa</i> in northern Central America.</p>
<p>The specimen from Chinajá was found in water in the axil of
    a large elephant-ear plant (<i>Xanthosoma</i>) by day in March. Its
    stomach contained fragments of beetles and a large roach. The
    natives did not know salamanders and had no name for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri</b> (Brocchi)</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Chinajá, 2; Río San Román, 1.</p>
</div>
<p>One specimen is a female having a snout-vent length of 80 mm.,
    a tail length of 82 mm., and a total length of 162 mm. It contains
    63 large eggs, the largest of which has a diameter of about three
    millimeters. This specimen has 13 costal grooves, four intercostal
    spaces between adpressed toes, and 12-13 vomerine teeth. A
    juvenile having a snout-vent length of 39 mm. and a tail length
    of 33 mm. has 12 costal grooves, three intercostal spaces between
    adpressed toes, and 8-8 vomerine teeth. In life these salamanders
    were uniformly dull brownish black above with a dull creamy
    yellow irregular dorsal stripe beginning on the occiput and continuing
    onto the tail. There are no yellow or orange streaks or
    flecks on the head or limbs. The specimen from the Río San Román
    was taken from the stomach of a <i>Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis</i> and has not been studied in detail, because of its poor condition.</p>
<p>The present specimens show no tendency for the development
    of a broad irregular dorsal band that encloses black spots or forms
    irregular dorsolateral stripes, as is characteristic of <i>B. moreleti
    mexicanus</i>, a subspecies that has been reported from La Libertad
    (Stuart, 1935:35) and Piedras Negras (Taylor and Smith, 1945:545)
    in El Petén, and from Xunantunich, British Honduras (Neill and
    Allen, 1959:20).</p>
<p>Schmidt (1936:151) and Stuart (1943:13) found <i>B. moreleti
    mulleri</i> in bromeliads at Finca Samac, Alta Verapaz. Taylor and
    Smith's (1945:545) and Neill and Allen's (1959:20) specimens of <i>B. moreleti mexicanus</i> were obtained from bromeliads, but Neill
    and Allen (<i>loc. cit.</i>) stated that the natives in British Honduras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> said that they had found salamanders beneath rubbish on the forest
    floor. My specimens were obtained from beneath logs on the
    forest floor in the rainy season. Possibly in drier environments the
    species characteristically inhabits bromeliads, at least in the dry
    season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Bufo marinus</b> (Linnaeus)</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Chinajá, 3; 10 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; 11 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.</p>
</div>
<p>During both visits to Chinajá this large toad was breeding in
    a small permanent pond in the camp. During the day the toads
    took refuge in crevices beneath the buildings or beneath large
    boulders by the pond. At dusk from four to ten males congregated
    at the pond and called. Tadpoles of this species were in the pond
    in March and in July. One juvenile was found beneath a rock in
    the forest, and another was on the forest floor by day.</p>
<p>The natives' name for this species and the following one is <i>sapo</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Bufo valliceps valliceps</b> Wiegmann</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Chinajá, 52; Río San Román, 8; Sayaxché, 2; Toocog, 1.</p>
</div>
<p>This is one of the most abundant, or at least conspicuous,
    amphibians inhabiting the forest. Breeding congregations were
    found on February 24, March 2, March 11, and June 27. At these
    times the toads were congregated at temporary ponds in the forest
    or along small sluggish streams. Throughout the duration of both
    visits to Chinajá individual males called almost nightly at the
    permanent pond at the camp.</p>
<p>The variation in snout-vent length of 20 males selected at
    random is 56.7 to 72.5 mm. (average, 64.8 mm.). Two adult females
    have snout-vent lengths of 80.4 and 87.6 mm. In all specimens
    the parotid glands are somewhat elongated and not rounded as in <i>Bufo valliceps wilsoni</i> (see Baylor and Stuart, 1961:199). My
    observations on the condition of the cranial crests of the toads in
    El Petén agree with the findings of Baylor and Stuart (<i>op. cit.</i>:198) in
    that hypertrophied crests are usual in large females. In the shape
    of the parotids and nature of the cranial crests the specimens from
    El Petén are like those from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in
    México. As I pointed out (1960:53), the validity of the subspecies <i>Bufo valliceps macrocristatus</i>, described from northern Chiapas by
    Firschein and Smith (1957:219) and supposedly characterized by
    hypertrophied cranial crests, is highly doubtful.</p>
<p>In the toads from El Petén the greatest variation is in coloration.
    The dorsal ground-color varies from orange and rusty tan to
    brown, yellowish tan, and pale gray. In some individuals the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> flanks and dorsum are one continuous color, whereas in others a
    distinct dorsolateral pale colored band separates the dorsal color
    from dark brown flanks. In some individuals the venter is
    uniform cream color, in others it bears a few scattered black spots,
    and in still others there are many spots, some of which are fused
    to form a black blotch on the chest. In breeding males the vocal
    sac is orange tan. All specimens have a coppery red iris.</p>
<p>Aside from the breeding congregations, active toads were found
    on the forest floor at night; a few were there by day. Some
    individuals were beneath logs during the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</b> (Werner)</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Chinajá, 10.</p>
</div>
<p>Because of the multiplicity of names and the variation in coloration,
    the small terrestrial <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> in southern México and
    northern Central America are in a state of taxonomic confusion.
    Stuart (1934:7, 1935:37, and 1958:17) referred specimens from El
    Petén to <i>Eleutherodactylus rhodopis</i> (Cope). Stuart (1941b:197)
    described <i>Eleutherodactylus anzuetoi</i> from Alta Verapaz and El
    Quiché, Guatemala, suggested that the new species was an upland
    relative of <i>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</i> (Werner), and used that
    name for the frogs that he earlier had referred to <i>Eleutherodactylus
    rhodopis</i>. Dunn and Emlen (1932:24) placed <i>E. rostralis</i> in the
    synonymy of <i>E. gollmeri</i> (Peters). Examination of series of these
    frogs from southern México, Guatemala, and Costa Rica causes me
    to think that there are four species; these can be distinguished as
    follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p><i>E. rhodopis.</i>&mdash;No web between toes; one tarsal tubercle; tibiotarsal articulation
        reaches to nostril; iris bronze in life.</p>
    <p><i>E. anzuetoi.</i>&mdash;No web between toes; a row of tarsal tubercles; tibiotarsal
        articulation reaches to tip of snout; color of iris unknown.</p>
    <p><i>E. rostralis.</i>&mdash;A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal tubercles; tibiotarsal
        articulation reaches snout or slightly beyond; iris coppery red in life.</p>
    <p><i>E. gollmeri.</i>&mdash;A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal tubercles; tibiotarsal
        articulation reaches well beyond snout; iris coppery red in life.</p>
</div>
<p>The presence of webbing between the toes, the absence of tarsal
    tubercles, and the coppery red iris distinguish <i>E. rostralis</i> and <i>E.
    gollmeri</i> from the other species. Probably <i>E. rostralis</i> and <i>E. gollmeri</i> are conspecific, but additional specimens are needed from Nicaragua
    and Honduras to prove conspecificity. On the other hand, the characters
    of the frogs from Chinajá clearly show that they are related
    to <i>E. gollmeri</i> to the south and not to <i>E. rhodopis</i> to the north in
    México.</p>
<p>At Chinajá, <i>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</i> was more abundant than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> the few specimens indicate, for upon being approached the frogs
    moved quickly and erratically, soon disappearing in the leaf litter
    on the forest floor. Most of the specimens were seen actively moving
    on the forest floor in the daytime; one was found beneath a rock,
    and one was on the forest floor at night.</p>

    due to the absence of rocky streams, a favorite habitat of this frog.

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Toocog, 66.</p>
</div>
<p>This small tree frog congregated in large numbers at a forest
    pond at Toocog. Between June 30 and July 2 we collected specimens
    and observed the breeding habits of this and other species
    at the pond. Calling males were distributed around the pond, where
    they called from low herbaceous vegetation at the edge of the pond
    or from plants rising above the water. Calling commenced at dusk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> and continued at least into the early hours of the morning. On one
    occasion a female was observed at a distance of about 50 centimeters
    away from a calling male sitting on a blade of grass. The
    female climbed another blade of grass until she was about eight
    centimeters away from the male, at which time he saw her, stopped
    calling, jumped to the blade of grass on which she was sitting and
    clasped her. Clasping pairs were observed on blades of grass and
    leaves of plants above the water; most pairs were less than 50
    centimeters above the surface of the pond.</p>
<p>The eggs are deposited on the dorsal surfaces of leaves above
    the water. All eggs are in one plane (a single layer) on the leaf. External
    membranes are barely visible, as the eggs consist of a single
    coherent mass. Eggs in the yolk plug stage have diameters of 1.2
    to 1.4 mm. Seventeen eggs masses were found; these contained from
    24 to 76 (average 44) eggs. The jelly is extremely viscous and tacky
    to the touch. At time of hatching the jelly becomes less viscous;
    the tadpoles wriggle until they reach the edge of the leaf and drop
    into the water.</p>
<p>Eleven tadpoles were preserved as they hatched; these have total
    lengths of 4.5 to 5.0 (average 4.77) mm. Hatchling tadpoles are
    active swimmers and have only a small amount of yolk. The largest
    tadpoles preserved have total lengths of 13.0 and 13.5 mm. At
    this size distinctive sword-tail and bright coloration have developed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Hyla staufferi</b> Cope</p>

    <p>Chinajá, 1.</p>
</div>
<p>This individual was calling from a low bush in the clearing at
    Chinajá. None was found in the pond in the forest at Toocog.
    Stuart (1935:38) and Duellman (1960:63) noted that <i>Hyla staufferi</i> breeds early in the rainy season. Nevertheless, I think early breeding
    habits do not account for the near absence of this species in
    our collections from southern El Petén. In early July, 1960, a few
    individuals were heard at a pond on the savanna at La Libertad. In
    mid-July of the same year they were calling sporadically from
    temporary ponds in the lower Motagua Valley. Possibly the individual
    collected at Chinajá was accidentally transported there in
    cargo from Toocog, from which camp at the edge of the savanna
    planes fly to Chinajá weekly. My observations on this species
    throughout its range in México and Central America indicate that it
    inhabits savannas and semi-arid forests and usually is absent
    from heavy rainforest. Stuart (1948:34) obtained this species at
    Cubilquitz in the lowlands of Alta Verapaz.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori</b> Funkhouser</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Toocog, 25.</p>
</div>
<p>Between June 30 and July 2 this species was abundant at a pond
    in the forest at Toocog. Calling males were as high as five meters
    in bushes and trees around the pond. At dusk males were observed
    descending a vine-covered tree at the edge of the pond; this
    strongly suggests that the frogs retreat to this tree and others like
    it for diurnal seclusion. Clasping pairs were found on branches
    and leaves above the water. The eggs are deposited in clumps
    usually on vertical leaves, but sometimes on horizontal leaves or
    on branches, vines, and aerial roots above the water. Twenty-six
    clutches of eggs contained from 14 to 44 (average 29) eggs. In
    a clutch in which the eggs are in yolk plug stage the average
    diameter of the embryos is 2.3 mm. and that of the vitelline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> membranes, 3.4 mm. Most of the eggs are in the external part
    of the gelatinous mass; the jelly is clear. The yolk is pale green,
    and the animal pole is brown. As development ensues, the yolk
    becomes yellow and the embryo first dark brown and then pale
    grayish tan. Upon hatching the tadpoles wriggle free of the
    jelly and drop into the water. One clutch of 19 eggs was observed
    to hatch in three minutes. Apparently, on dropping into the
    water the hatchling tadpoles go to the bottom of the pond, for one
    or two minutes pass from the time they enter the water until they
    reappear near the surface. The average total length of seven
    hatchling tadpoles is 7.4 mm. There is a moderate amount of
    yolk, but this does not form a large ventral bulge. Large tadpoles
    congregate in the sunny parts of the pond, where they were observed
    just beneath the surface. Many had their mouths at the
    surface. Except for constant fluttering of the tip of the tail, they
    lie quietly with the axis of the body at an angle of about 45 degrees
    with the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Description of tadpole (KU 60006): total length, 24.5 mm.; tail-length,
    15.4 mm.; body broader than deep; head moderately flattened;

    directed dorsally; eyes of moderate size and directed laterally; mouth
    directed anteroventrally; anus median; spiracle ventral, its opening
    just to left of midline slightly more than one-half distance from tip
    of snout to vent. Tail-fin slightly more than twice as deep as tail
    musculature, which curves upward posteriorly; tail-fin narrowly

<p>One adult male having a snout-vent length of 89 mm. was found
    beneath a log in the forest. Locally this gecko is known as <i>escorpión</i>; the natives believe it to be deadly poisonous. The use
    of the name <i>escorpión</i> seems to be restricted to lizards thought to
    be venomous. Nearly everywhere in México and Central America
    some species of lizard carries this appellation. In El Petén I heard
    the name used only for <i>Coleonyx elegans</i> and <i>Thecadactylus rapicaudus</i>;
    in the lowlands of Guerrero, México, the name is applied
    to geckos of the genus <i>Phyllodactylus</i>. The venomous lizards of
    the genus <i>Heloderma</i> in the lowlands of western México are called <i>escorpiónes</i>. In the mountains of southern México various skinks
    of the genus <i>Eumeces</i>, as well as lizards of the genus <i>Xenosaurus</i>,
    carry the same appellation. <i>Abronia</i> in the mountains of México
    and <i>Gerrhonontus</i> throughout México and Central America likewise
    are called <i>escorpiónes</i>. Although many people in various parts of
    Middle America consider most lizards poisonous, there is a unanimity
    of opinion concerning the venomous qualities of the various
    kinds of <i>escorpiónes</i>. I know of only two other lizards in Middle
    America that are so uniformly regarded in native beliefs; these
    are <i>Enyaliosaurus clarki</i> in the Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacán,

    the tree or ducked to the other side of the buttress; if the observer
    moved closer, they jumped to the ground and ran off. None was
    observed to ascend large trees. Some individuals were observed

<p>One of the large males displayed a defensive behavior prior to

    approached, the lizard turned its flanks towards me; then it flattened
    the body laterally, extended the dewlap, opened its mouth, and

    the color of the venter. Similar variation is known in <i>D. melanolomus

    venters. This color phase has been recognized as a distinct
    species, <i>Dryadophis sanguiventris</i>, by Taylor (1954:722). Examination
    of 18 specimens from Costa Rica shows no differences in
    scutellation, nor geographic segregation of two populations. I am
    convinced that the red-bellied <i>Dryadophis</i> in Costa Rica, like those
    in Guatemala, represent a color phase of the subspecies inhabiting

<p>One female (KU 57156) having 230 ventrals and 54 caudals
    was found on the forest floor by day. This individual has a black
    snout with a white bar across the nasals and prefrontals, a white
    spot in the middle of the frontal, and a white band across the
    temporals and parietals that is bordered posteriorly by a black
    band. There are 28 white and 28 red rings on the body. The
    tips of the red scales are darkened. The black rings between the
    white and red rings are not so expanded as to interrupt the white
    rings dorsally as in <i>L. doliata abnorma</i> as identified by Stuart
    (1948:70). Locally this snake, like all red, black, and white or

    in the rainy season. At a pond in the forest at Toocog these snakes
    were observed on low vegetation, on the ground, and in the water.
    Evidently they congregate at breeding choruses of frogs. One <i>Leptodeira</i> contained a <i>Smilisca baudini</i> and another contained

    southern El Petén, one has an internasal:eye ratio of 1.08; the other

<p>Listed below are thirteen species that have not been found in
    southern El Petén but that probably occur there.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p><b><i>Dermophis mexicanus mexicanus</i></b> (Duméril and Bibron).&mdash;Natives at Chinajá
        know caecilians, which they call <i>dos cabezas</i>. This species has been taken
        in Tabasco and northern Chiapas. Its occurrence in southern El Petén is expected.
        Less likely, the caecilian known to the natives at Chinajá is <i>Gymnopis
        oligozona</i>, which is known from Finca Volcán on the southern slopes of the
        valley of the Río Cahabón in Alta Verapaz.</p>
    <p><b><i>Gastrophryne elegans</i></b> (Boulenger).&mdash;This small fossorial frog is known from
        Piedras Negras (Taylor and Smith, 1945:604), 12 miles east of Yaxha
        (Stuart, 1934:7), and Tikal (Stuart, 1958:18), all in northern and central
        El Petén. Two specimens in the collection of the University of Kansas are
        from 28 kilometers northeast of Campur, Alta Verapaz. Probably the species
        ranges throughout the forested lowlands of northern Alta Verapaz and El
        Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Mabuya brachypoda</i></b> Taylor.&mdash;The absence of this widespread lizard in our
        collections cannot be explained. Probably it occurs in southern El Petén,
        for it is known in northern and central El Petén and in Alta Verapaz.</p>
    <p><b><i>Dendrophidion vinitor</i></b> Smith.&mdash;This snake is known from Piedras Negras,
        El Petén and from various localities in Alta Verapaz; it is an inhabitant of
        humid forest and should occur in southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Elaphe triaspis mutabilis</i></b> (Cope).&mdash;The subspecies <i>E. triaspis mutabilis</i> is
        known from Alta Verapaz and <i>E. triaspis triaspis</i> from the Yucatán Peninsula,
        British Honduras, and Uaxactún in northern El Petén. Because of the
        much higher degree of resemblance between the faunas of southern El Petén
        and Alta Verapaz as compared with southern El Petén and Yucatán, <i>E. triaspis
        mutabilis</i> would be expected to occur in southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Ninia diademata nietoi</i></b> Burger and Werler.&mdash;This snake is known from Tikal
        and from Alta Verapaz; it is a small cryptophile that probably occurs in
        southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Oxyrhophus petola aequifasciatus</i></b> Werner.&mdash;This snake, which probably
        is conspecific with <i>Oxyrhophus baileyi</i> in southern Veracruz, México, is known
        from Tikal, British Honduras, and Alta Verapaz; it is expected in southern
        El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Pliocercus elapoides salvini</i></b> Müller.&mdash;This species is widespread in the Atlantic
        lowlands of southern México and northern Central America; the subspecies <i>P. elapoides salvini</i> occurs in Alta Verapaz and probably in southern
        El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Rhadinaea decorata decorata</i></b> (Günther).&mdash;This is another small cryptophile
        that is widespread on the Atlantic lowlands from México to Panamá; it
        definitely is expected at places like Chinajá in southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Scaphiodontophis annulatus</i></b> (Duméril and Bibron).&mdash;Three subspecies of <i>Scaphiodontophis annulatus</i> are recognized in northern Central America: <i>S. annulatus annulatus</i> from Alta Verapaz, <i>S. annulatus hondurensis</i> from
        northern Honduras, and <i>S. annulatus carpicinctus</i> from Piedras Negras and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> Tikal in El Petén and from British Honduras. This rare and highly variable
        species probably occurs in southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Tantilla schistosa schistosa</i></b> (Bocourt).&mdash;This widespread species in Central
        America is known from several localities in Alta Verapaz and almost certainly
        occurs in southern El Petén.</p>
    <p><b><i>Tropidodipsas sartori sartori</i></b> Cope.&mdash;This fossorial species has been collected
        in northern El Petén and in Alta Verapaz. The natives at Chinajá described
        to me a <i>coral</i> having orange rings on a black body that likely was this species.</p>
    <p><b><i>Micrurus elegans veraepacis</i></b> Schmidt.&mdash;This species has been collected at
        various localities in Alta Verapaz and in Chiapas, inhabits areas like those
        in southern El Petén, and probably occurs there.</p>

<h2><a name="SUMMARY" id="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>A study of the amphibians and reptiles in the rainforests of
    southern El Petén, Guatemala, reveals the presence of 78 species;
    an additional 13 species probably occur there. In this tropical area
    having a high amount of rainfall most of the species of amphibians
    and reptiles have extensive ranges in the wet forests on the Atlantic
    lowlands of southern México and northern Central America; some
    species that more frequently are found in sub-humid forests also
    occur.</p>
<p>Ecologically the fauna is divided into five major habitats&mdash;aquatic,
    aquatic margin, fossorial, terrestrial, and arboreal. Forty-two
    per cent of the 78 species are wholly or partly arboreal. The
    fauna is most closely related to that in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala,
    but includes many species that occur in the Tikal-Uaxactún area in
    northeastern Guatemala.</p>
<p><i>Eleutherodactylus rostralis</i> (Werner) and <i>E. rhodopis</i> (Cope)
    are redefined and their relationships are suggested. The color
    phases of <i>Dryadophis melanolomus laevis</i> and <i>D. m. alternatus</i> are
    discussed; <i>Dryadophis sanguiventris</i> Taylor is synonymized with <i>Dryadophis melanolomus alternatus</i> (Bocourt).</p>
<p>The breeding habits, eggs, and tadpoles of the hylid frogs <i>Hyla
    ebraccata</i> and <i>Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori</i> are described, as
    are the eggs and juveniles of <i>Laemanctus deborrei</i>.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
